## Welcome

This is the Qiskit Fall Fest event for SRM Institute of Science and Technology. We're so excited to have you all here. This event is being hosted by the SQCC club, the quantum tech club of SRM KRT.

The SRM Quantum Computing Club is a dynamic student organization at SRM University, united by a passion for quantum computing. Through engaging workshops and interactive sessions, we explore quantum mechanics, algorithms, and practical applications. Hands-on learning with cutting-edge platforms like Qiskit and Cirq enhances our problem-solving skills and understanding.

The Qiskit Fall Fest is a collection of quantum computing events on college campuses around the world. Every Fall Fest event is organized and run by the students on each campus, with support from the entire IBM Quantum team. Student leaders work alongside IBM to host tech events. The events vary from technical hackathons to beginner-friendly Hackathon, all with the goal of helping to grow the local communityâ€™s skill set.

The Fall Fest here at SRM University is going to be a Quantum Hackathon, starting on October. Details about the Hackathon and rules can be found below. The deadline for Registration 13 October 2024 . Good luck!
